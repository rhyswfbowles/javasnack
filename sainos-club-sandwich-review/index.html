    <h2>Taste</h2>

    <p>
      The sweet, creamy Emmental provides a subtle undertone matching well with
      the stronger, smoked bacon - no flavour clashes here. This is clearly a
      well designed sandwich, full marks to the Sainsbury's sandwich developers.
      The white bread, although controversial and often flavourless, does a good
      job here by providing the perfect vessel for a classic sandwich that
      stands the test of time.

    <h2>Presentation</h2>

    <p>
      The faux-toasted look of the bread is appealing, tricking the consumer
      into believing it's a far more premium product than it is. The only
      downside here is that one might expect a slight crunch, so the first bite
      was inevitably slightly jarring. I think the sandwich could have done with
      a little more "glue", as a portable food, you want it to stay together as
      one consolidated unit, but I often noticed the triple decker trying to
      fall apart.

    <h2>Value for Money</h2>

    <p>
      It's a Sainos lunchtime classic, at 2 pounds something, you really
      couldn't ask for much more. Would highly recommend sampling as soon as
      possible - it's obviously a popular choice.
